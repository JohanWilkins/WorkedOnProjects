1.  Restaurant System was a project handed in by me for a Summative Assessment Project for CTU Training Solutions. The premise behind the system is to create a POS (Point of Sales) that can be run on basic computing systems. The code also saves the slips that can then be printed and handed over to the customers. It writes up all the totals and calculates that at the end of the day as well.
